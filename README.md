# My Top Nine
Do you remember MySpace Top 8 friends ? Well this is MyTopNine - a website that lets users select their Top-Nine in a variety of categories (sports, video games, makeup, movies, etc..)

## Landing-page
This is the first landing page I have created. I used HTML, CSS, LESS and JavaScript to put together this static landing page with an about section. 

#### I started on this project after completing the week 4 unit: Web Foundations
The *Web Foundations* unit explored the following topics:
- User Interfaces 1 - 3
- Git for Web Development
- Responsive Design 1 - 2
- Pre-Processors 1 - 2
- JavaScript Fundamentals 1 - 4
