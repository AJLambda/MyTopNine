# My Top Nine
Do you remember MySpace Top 8 friends ? Well this is MyTopNine - a website that lets users select their Top-Nine in a variety of categories (sports, video games, makeup, movies, etc..)

## Landing-page
This is the first landing page I have ever deployed. I used HTML, CSS, LESS and JavaScript to create a static landing page and then later updated it to React for future scalability.

## Tech Stack

1. React
2. React-Router
3. Sass

5. React Reveal 
6. Font Awesome
7. React-burger-menu
